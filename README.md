Methodology
1. Song Duration Across Different Genres
•	Approach: Grouped the dataset by genre and calculated the average song duration for each genre. Visualized results using a bar plot.
2. Correlation Between Song Popularity and Explicit Content
•	Approach: Calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between song popularity and explicit content.
3. Distribution of Danceability Scores Across Different Years
•	Approach: Grouped the dataset by year and calculated summary statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation) of danceability scores. Used a violin plot for visualization.
4. Trends in Energy Levels of Songs Over the Years
•	Approach: Grouped the dataset by year and calculated the average energy level of songs for each year. Visualized trends using a line plot.
5. Popularity of Top Hits Among Top 10 Artists
•	Approach: Grouped the dataset by artist to calculate total songs and average popularity for the top 10 artists. Visualized the relationship using a horizontal bar plot.
6. Distribution of Songs with and Without Explicit Content
•	Approach: Grouped the dataset by explicit content and counted the number of songs. Represented distribution with a pie chart.
7. Relationship Between Acousticness and Song Valence
•	Approach: Calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between acousticness and valence.
8. Differences in Tempo Across Modes (Major vs. Minor)
•	Approach: Grouped the dataset by mode and calculated the average tempo for major and minor modes. Compared average tempos.
9. Popularity of Genres Over the Years
•	Approach: Grouped the dataset by year and genre, calculated average popularity, and visualized trends using a line plot.
10. Relationship Between Song Liveliness and Instrumentalness
•	Approach: Calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between liveliness and instrumentalness.
Insights and Recommendations
1. Song Duration Across Different Genres
Insight: Duration varies significantly across genres. Recommendation: Artists should consider genre-specific trends in song duration when creating music. Streaming services can curate playlists with diverse song lengths.
2. Correlation Between Song Popularity and Explicit Content
Insight: Very weak correlation between popularity and explicit content. Recommendation: Focus on song quality and audience engagement rather than explicit content alone.
3. Distribution of Danceability Scores Across Different Years
Insight: Danceability scores have increased over recent years. Recommendation: Align new releases with danceability trends and experiment with danceable elements in music production.
4. Trends in Energy Levels of Songs Over the Years
Insight: Energy levels have fluctuated, with peaks in the mid-2010s and 2020. Recommendation: Monitor energy level trends to align with listener preferences and emphasize high-energy tracks during peak periods.
5. Popularity of Top Hits Among Top 10 Artists
Insight: Variation in average popularity among top artists. Recommendation: Balance the number of songs with maintaining high popularity and optimize marketing efforts based on release schedules and artist performance.
6. Distribution of Songs With and Without Explicit Content
Insight: Higher number of songs with explicit content. Recommendation: Adjust content policies and curate playlists that cater to various preferences regarding explicit content.
7. Relationship Between Acousticness and Song Valence
Insight: Weak negative relationship between acousticness and valence. Recommendation: Consider balancing acoustic and emotional qualities in music production to meet diverse listener preferences.
8. Differences in Tempo Across Modes (Major vs. Minor)
Insight: Minor modes have slightly higher average tempo. Recommendation: Experiment with different modes to achieve varied tempo and enhance the dynamic range of compositions.
9. Popularity of Genres Over the Years
Insight: Genre popularity has evolved, reflecting changing listener preferences. Recommendation: Stay updated on genre trends to align new releases with audience interests and target marketing strategies effectively.
10. Relationship Between Song Liveliness and Instrumentalness
Insight: Very weak relationship between liveliness and instrumentalness. Recommendation: Focus on creating lively tracks without being overly concerned about instrumentalness. Explore other factors influencing song success.
Conclusion
The analysis of the Spotify dataset provides valuable insights into song attributes and trends. The recommendations are designed to guide artists, producers, and marketing teams in making informed decisions to align with audience preferences and industry trends.
